Data Through Date: The date up to which the data in the dataset is valid or relevant.
Project ID: A unique identifier for each solar power project in the dataset.
Interconnection Date: The date when the solar power project was connected to the grid or power distribution system.
Utility: The utility company or organization responsible for managing the power grid and distributing electricity.
City/Town: The location of the solar power project (city or town).
County: The administrative division within the state where the solar project is situated.
Zip: The postal code or ZIP code corresponding to the projectâ€™s location.
Division: A further geographical subdivision within the state (if applicable).
Substation: The electrical substation where the solar power project is connected to the grid.
Circuit ID: The unique identifier for the circuit within the substation that the solar project is connected to.
Developer: The entity or organization responsible for developing and implementing the solar power project.
Metering Method: The method used to measure and record the solar energy production (e.g., net metering, gross metering).
Estimated PV System Size (kWdc): The estimated size of the photovoltaic (PV) system in kilowatts direct current (kWdc). This represents the total capacity of the solar panels.
PV System Size (kWac): The actual size of the PV system in kilowatts alternating current (kWac). This accounts for system losses and efficiency.
Estimated Annual PV Energy Production (kWh): The projected annual energy production from the PV system in kilowatt-hours (kWh). This estimate considers factors like solar irradiance, panel orientation, and efficiency.
Energy Storage System Size (kWac): If applicable, the size of any energy storage system (such as batteries) connected to the solar project, measured in kilowatts alternating current (kWac).
Number of Projects: The total count of solar power projects represented in the dataset.
