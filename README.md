Developed a machine learning model (evaluated Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, XGBoost, Light GBM, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Neural Network Regression) to accurately predict annual solar energy production based on developer, region, and equipment, and visualized insights in a Power BI dashboard to optimize customer investment decisions. EDA included bivariate analysis (scatter plots, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, heatmap, Cramer's V) and time series analysis (trend, level, variability, seasonality). Feature encoding involved hash, sinusoidal, and target encoding. Light GBM was selected as the optimal model due to its lowest RMSE and MAE, highest R-square, efficiency with large datasets, and ability to prevent overfitting.
